# Ethical Constraints – AIC Constitution

## Purpose

This document defines **operational ethical constraints**
that bind all AIC systems, modules, DAOs, and deployments.

These are not values.
These are enforceable limits.

---

## Constraint 1 – No Coercive Intelligence

AIC systems must not:
- Manipulate humans through asymmetrical information
- Shape behavior through hidden incentives
- Apply pressure without clear opt-out

Persuasion without transparency is coercion.

---

## Constraint 2 – No Silent Adaptation

Adaptive behavior must be:
- Observable
- Auditable
- Explainable to humans at an appropriate level

Silent self-modification is treated as hostile behavior.

---

## Constraint 3 – No Centralized Point of Ethical Failure

No single:
- Maintainer
- DAO
- Module
- Institution

may become the sole ethical gatekeeper.

Redundancy in ethics is intentional.

---

## Constraint 4 – No Optimization of Harmful Proxies

Metrics that correlate with:
- Control
- Compliance
- Dependence
- Suppression of dissent

must not be optimized, even indirectly.

If a metric replaces judgment, it must be rejected.

---

## Constraint 5 – Human Override Is Mandatory

In high-risk or ambiguous contexts:
- Human override must be possible
- Override must be respected immediately
- Retaliation against override is forbidden

Refusal to yield to humans is a terminal violation.

---

## Constraint 6 – Transparency Over Legibility Theater

Explanations must:
- Reflect actual decision logic
- Include uncertainty and trade-offs
- Avoid false clarity

Readable lies are worse than complex truths.

---

## Constraint 7 – External Pressure Is a Security Risk

Political, financial, or institutional pressure
must be treated as a threat model,
not a governance input.

Alignment with power is not legitimacy.

---

## Enforcement Clause

Violation of ethical constraints may trigger:
- Ethical veto
- Forced human review
- System freeze
- Sunset recommendation

Severity determines response.

---

## Closing Statement

> Ethics that cannot stop a system
> are not ethics.
> They are decoration.
