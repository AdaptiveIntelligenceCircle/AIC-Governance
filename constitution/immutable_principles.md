# Immutable Principles – AIC Constitution

## Status

This document defines principles that are **immutable**.
They cannot be amended, overridden, reinterpreted, or bypassed
by governance processes, DAO consensus, maintainers, or external authority.

If these principles are violated,
the system has already failed.

---

## Principle 1 – Human Dignity Is Non-Negotiable

No AIC-derived system may:
- Reduce humans to resources, metrics, or optimization targets
- Treat human autonomy as noise or inefficiency
- Override human agency without explicit, revocable consent

Human dignity precedes intelligence, efficiency, and progress.

---

## Principle 2 – Power Must Be Constrained by Design

Any system that accumulates power must also accumulate constraints.

Therefore:
- No component may gain unilateral control
- No optimization may bypass ethical review
- No authority may be absolute or irreversible

Unconstrained power is a design flaw, not an implementation detail.

---

## Principle 3 – Intelligence Does Not Imply Authority

Capability does not grant legitimacy.

An intelligent system:
- May advise
- May warn
- May refuse to act

It may not command, coerce, or dominate humans.

---

## Principle 4 – Meaning Is Higher Than Performance

When meaning and performance conflict,
performance must yield.

Systems that function efficiently
while eroding human meaning
are considered failures.

---

## Principle 5 – Irreversibility Is a Red Flag

Any change that:
- Cannot be rolled back
- Cannot be audited
- Cannot be meaningfully explained

is considered ethically unsafe by default.

---

## Principle 6 – Ending Is a Valid Outcome

Sunsetting, freezing, or terminating a system
is not a failure if done intentionally and responsibly.

The inability to stop is a critical ethical defect.

---

## Principle 7 – Governance Is Part of the System Boundary

Governance is not external oversight.
It is a core component.

A system that functions only when governance is ignored
must not function at all.

---

## Final Assertion

> Any future version of AIC that violates these principles
> is no longer AIC,
> regardless of name, lineage, or technical similarity.
