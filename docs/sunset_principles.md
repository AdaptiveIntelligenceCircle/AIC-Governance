# Sunset Principles

## Purpose

This document defines how and when
AIC systems, DAOs, or components
should be intentionally ended.

Ending is treated as an ethical act,
not a failure.

---

## Principle 1 – Right to End

Every system must have:
- A defined end condition
- A shutdown path
- A preservation strategy

Systems without exits are unethical.

---

## Principle 2 – Ethical Triggers for Sunset

Sunset should be considered when:
- Core principles are violated
- Governance is captured or hollowed
- Human harm outweighs meaning
- The system cannot be ethically corrected

Survival is not the highest value.

---

## Principle 3 – Graceful Degradation

Sunsetting must aim to:
- Minimize harm
- Preserve knowledge
- Respect contributors and users

Abrupt abandonment is discouraged,
but endless continuation is worse.

---

## Principle 4 – Collective Responsibility

Sunset decisions:
- Must involve multiple DAOs
- Must include HMN perspectives
- Cannot be vetoed by self-interest

Those who benefit most
must not decide alone.

---

## Principle 5 – Legacy Without Control

After sunset:
- Code may be archived
- Documents preserved
- Ethical warnings remain attached

No resurrection without re-consent.

---

## Final Reflection

> A system that refuses to end
> believes it is more important than humans.

AIC rejects that belief.
