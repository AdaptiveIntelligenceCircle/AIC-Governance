# Governance Principles

## Purpose

These principles guide how decisions are made,
how disagreement is handled,
and how power is prevented from accumulating.

They apply to all AIC-affiliated DAOs.

---

## Principle 1 – Meaning-Based Governance

Decisions are evaluated by:
- Ethical coherence
- Human impact
- Long-term meaning

Not by:
- Token weight
- Capital contribution
- Influence or status

Meaning is the primary governance signal.

---

## Principle 2 – Distributed Ethical Authority

No single DAO,
committee,
or individual
may claim final ethical authority.

Ethics emerge from:
- Cross-DAO dialogue
- Dissent
- Deliberation

Centralization is treated as a risk.

---

## Principle 3 – Right to Dissent

Dissent is not noise.
It is governance data.

Silencing dissent,
even for efficiency,
is an ethical violation.

---

## Principle 4 – Preference for Non-Action

When ethical uncertainty is high,
inaction is a valid and often preferred decision.

Speed is never a moral requirement.

---

## Principle 5 – Accountability Over Control

Governance exists to:
- Explain decisions
- Accept consequences
- Enable correction

Not to enforce obedience.

---

## Principle 6 – Temporary Authority

All authority is:
- Contextual
- Time-bound
- Revocable

Permanence is incompatible with ethics.

---

## Closing Principle

> Governance that cannot say “no”
> cannot be trusted to say “yes”.
