# Ethical Disclosure – AIC

## Why This Exists

AIC develops systems that may influence:
- Human decision-making
- Power distribution
- Autonomy and control
- Societal stability

Ethical disclosure is not optional.
It is part of the system boundary.

---

## What Must Be Disclosed

Any contributor proposing or implementing functionality that:
- Adapts behavior autonomously
- Learns from humans or environments
- Influences trust, incentives, or authority
- Could be repurposed beyond stated intent

must disclose:
- Intended use
- Plausible misuse
- Ethical trade-offs
- Known limitations
- Assumptions about humans and institutions

---

## Disclosure Format

Ethical disclosures should be:
- Explicit
- Written
- Linked to the relevant code or design
- Understandable to non-specialists

Silence is not neutrality.
Silence is risk.

---

## Known Risks (Non-Exhaustive)

AIC acknowledges inherent risks including:
- Emergent behavior beyond designer intent
- Gradual ethical drift
- Institutional capture
- Misinterpretation as authority or governance replacement
- Weaponization by external actors

These risks are documented, not denied.

---

## Refusal to Disclose

Failure to disclose ethical implications may result in:
- Rejection of contribution
- Removal of code
- Revocation of contributor trust

This is not punishment.
It is containment.

---

## Ethical Honesty Clause

We accept that:
- Some risks cannot be eliminated
- Some failures will occur
- Some questions have no clean answer

What we do not accept is pretending otherwise.

## Closing Statement

> Ethics is not a constraint on intelligence.
> It is the condition for intelligence to remain human.
