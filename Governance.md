# Governance Model – Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC)

## Purpose

This document defines how decisions are made within AIC,
especially when technical power intersects with ethical risk.

Governance exists to **slow down power**, not accelerate it.

---

## Core Principles

AIC governance is built on:

- Human dignity over system efficiency
- Ethical restraint over raw capability
- Long-term civilizational impact over short-term success
- Distributed responsibility over centralized authority

No single individual, organization, or sponsor owns AIC.

---

## Decision Domains

Governance applies to decisions involving:

- Core architecture changes
- Adaptive or self-modifying mechanisms
- Trust, defense, or rollback systems
- Governance, ethics, or simulation boundaries
- External deployment with real-world impact

Routine refactors do not require governance review.

---

## Decision Process

### 1. Proposal
Any significant change must include:
- Motivation
- Technical design
- Ethical analysis
- Failure modes
- Abuse scenarios

### 2. Review
Maintainers and reviewers evaluate:
- Technical soundness
- Alignment with AIC philosophy
- Potential misuse or drift
- Reversibility and containment

### 3. Resolution
Decisions are made by:
- Consensus where possible
- Ethical veto where necessary

Speed is never prioritized over responsibility.

---

## Ethical Veto

Any maintainer may invoke an **ethical veto** if they believe a proposal:
- Enables coercion, surveillance, or manipulation
- Centralizes power irreversibly
- Undermines human agency
- Introduces silent or uncontrollable behavior

A veto must be justified in writing.
Vetoes are respected, not overridden by majority vote.

---

## Conflict Resolution

When disagreement persists:
- Pause implementation
- Document all positions
- Prefer non-action over irreversible action

AIC accepts delayed progress over ethical regret.

---

## Governance Drift

If governance itself becomes compromised:
- Any contributor may raise a governance concern
- Governance documents may be revised with extreme caution
- Transparency is mandatory

---

## Final Assertion

> Intelligence without governance becomes dominance.
> Governance without courage becomes theater.

AIC chooses courage.
