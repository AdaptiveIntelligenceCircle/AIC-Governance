# Contributing to AIC

Thank you for considering contributing to Adaptive Intelligence Circle.

This is not a typical open-source project.
We value **depth, integrity, and long-term responsibility** over speed.

---

## What We Welcome

We welcome contributions in the form of:

- Core architecture design
- Governance and ethics frameworks
- Simulation and safety tooling
- Documentation and formal reasoning
- Critical review and adversarial thinking

Quality > Quantity.

---

## Before You Start

Please:
1. Read the README and project philosophy
2. Understand the long-term vision (AIC / AIN / HMN)
3. Ask yourself:
   > “Does this make the system more humane, not just more powerful?”

---

## Contribution Principles

- No hidden intent
- No rushed patches
- No blind optimization
- No ego-driven design

All changes should be:
- Explainable
- Reviewable
- Reversible
- Governable

---

## Code Standards

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Explicit > implicit
- Defensive programming is encouraged
- Every adaptive mechanism must have:
  - Constraints
  - Failure modes
  - Rollback paths

---

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a focused branch
3. Clearly describe:
   - Motivation
   - Design reasoning
   - Trade-offs
   - Risks
4. Expect deep review — this is intentional

---

## Non-Goals

We do NOT accept:
- Surveillance-oriented features
- Growth-at-all-costs logic
- Centralized control primitives disguised as optimization
- Code that cannot be ethically defended

---

## Final Note

Contributing to AIC is an **ethical commitment**, not just a technical one.

If you are here only to build power,
this is not the right project.

If you are here to build responsibility,
you are welcome.
