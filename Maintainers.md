# Maintainers – AIC

## Role of Maintainers

Maintainers are not project owners.
They are **stewards of intent, ethics, and architecture**.

Their authority exists to:
- Protect the system from misuse
- Preserve philosophical coherence
- Enforce governance and security standards

---

## Responsibilities

Maintainers are expected to:

- Review contributions rigorously
- Enforce Code of Conduct and Security Policy
- Exercise ethical veto when necessary
- Resist external pressure (financial, political, social)
- Prioritize long-term consequences over popularity

Maintainers must lead by restraint, not dominance.

---

## Accountability

Maintainers are accountable to:
- The documented philosophy of AIC
- The governance framework
- The contributor community
- Future users who cannot yet speak

Authority without accountability is invalid.

---

## Selection and Removal

- Maintainers are selected based on trust and demonstrated judgment
- No automatic promotion based on activity or seniority
- Maintainers may step down voluntarily
- Maintainers may be removed if trust is broken

Removal is based on behavior, not ideology.

---

## Conflict of Interest

Maintainers must disclose:
- Commercial interests
- Institutional affiliations
- External incentives related to AIC

Undisclosed conflicts are treated as security risks.

---

## Maintainer Ethos

A maintainer must be willing to:
- Say “no” when others say “ship it”
- Delay progress to prevent harm
- Accept criticism without retaliation
- Walk away rather than betray core values

---

## Closing Note

> The most dangerous moment for a system
> is when its guardians stop questioning themselves.

Maintainers exist to prevent that moment.
